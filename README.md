Hello!

My name is Mardoqueo Arteaga but feel free to call me Marc for short! I was born in El Salvador and have been residing in the United States for many years. 
I am a first year Ph.D. Economics student at Fordham University in New York City. My interests revolve around a few spheres including behavioral, financial and monetary economics. I am also interested in international economic policy design.
